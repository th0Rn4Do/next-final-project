This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Next.js Final project - FindAmusician 2023

- Next.js
- Postgres.js

## Database Setup

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env` (ignored from Git) and fill in the necessary information.

Follow the instructions from the PostgreSQL step in [UpLeveled's System Setup Instructions](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/blob/master/readme.md).

Then, connect to the built-in `postgres` database as administrator in order to create the database:

**Windows**

If it asks for a password, use `postgres`.

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

**macOS**

```bash
psql postgres
```

**Linux**

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Once you have connected, run the following to create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database name>;
CREATE USER <user name> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<user password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database name> TO <user name>;
\connect <database name>;
CREATE SCHEMA <user name> AUTHORIZATION <user name>;
```

Quit `psql` using the following command:

```bash
\q
```

On Linux, you will also need to create a Linux system user with a name matching the user name you used in the database. It will prompt you to create a password for the user - choose the same password as for the database above.

```bash
sudo adduser <user name>
```

Once you're ready to use the new user, reconnect using the following command.

**Windows and macOS:**

```bash
psql -U <user name> <database name>
```

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo -u <user name> psql -U <user name> <database name>
```

# API DESIGN

```ts
type User = {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  // Omit passwordHash for security
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  genre: string;
  personal_description: string | null;
  music_instrument: string | null;
};

type Error = {
  message: string;
};
```

```txt

/users
 - GET =>       user[]
 - POST =>      user   | error

/users/:id
 - PUT =>       user   | error
 - DELETE =>    user   | error
 - GET =>       user   | error
